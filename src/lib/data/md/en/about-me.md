Hello Everyone 👋  
I'm **Peter** from **Slovakia**. I've always had a strong curiosity for digital technologies—from computers and websites to how things work behind the scenes. However, life initially took me in a different direction, away from tech.

That changed more than **three years ago**, when I made a bold decision to turn things around and pursue what I truly enjoy. I enrolled in the **Front-End Engineer Career Path** at Codecademy, and since then, I’ve been hooked.

I ❤️ every bit of web development—from building clean, responsive interfaces to bringing ideas to life with code.

As I kept learning and growing, I quickly realized that **Full-Stack Development** is where my passion lies. The ability to work on both the frontend and backend gives me a complete view of how applications work, and I enjoy the challenge of solving problems across the entire stack.

I'm currently expanding my skills in areas like:

- Front-End
  - React.js, Vue.js, Svelte
- Meta Frameworks
  - Next.js, Nuxt, Sveltekit, Astro
- Back-End
  - REST API, Express, PostgreSQL, Firebase DB
- Authentication and full-stack app deployment

My goal is to build **meaningful, user-friendly applications** that not only work well but also make a difference. I’m excited to continue this journey, collaborate with others, and keep leveling up as a developer.

Thanks for stopping by! 👨‍💻
